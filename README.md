# Welcome
This project aims to research, investigate, and potentially create algorithms that can be used to create a procedurally generated game based on a linear story in the 8-bit and 16-bit format. The game created will follow common aesthetic rules in art, make sense from an average viewers standpoint, and generate levels/areas dynamically.
